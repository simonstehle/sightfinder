   "Kurzinfo": "\"MJELLBY ART MUSEUM houses a large, permanent collection of the works of the Halmstad Group, enabling it to host both broad-based exhibitions and themed features. \nIn 2015 we will be focusing on the six individual artists who were attracted by the expression of modernism and travelled to Stockholm, Berlin or Paris in the 1920s to expand their education. We will also look at how they returned home to Sweden after a while to seek out like-minded people and establish a new art movement. \nThe Halmstad Group was formed in 1929 with the intention of joining forces to create facilities to host exhibitions and to offer artistic inspiration to one another. The artists adopted the expressions of cubism, constructivism and surrealism, but also established themselves as respected set designers, stylish illustrators and skilled decorators of the urban environment. \nThe Halmstad Group enjoyed tremendous national success and their art continues to fascinate many to this day!\""
